       "5     Difficult to get academic support or can or find it because there are hardly an good tutors for UH. I pay my tuition and expect it but every semester UH fails to provide. Also certain TA’s don’t understand the professors guidelines very well and grade incorrectly. Many also do not know how to speak English very well and there difficult to communicate with. I understand UH is a lower tier University than Ivy League or any decent university but they can at least allocate funds for decent tutoring. But time and time again it’s proven that if you want a low cost degree with minimal to no quality, UH is the best at it.\n",
